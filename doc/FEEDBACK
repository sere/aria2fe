FEEDBACK/WISHLIST/DONATIONS


Feedback is appreciated; good, bad or indifferent. Please submit feedback via
the Tracker or Forum areas at http://sourceforge.net/projects/aria2fe/.

If there are features you would to see added to aria2fe or features that could
be improved, submit your requests via the Tracker->Feature Requests at the web
address above. Please be specific in your request as well as describing the
benefits to all users that would be gained if your request was to be included
in aria2fe.

For the first few months post release I will be gathering information on which
features/options/arguments should remain or be placed on the Main Window and
which of them should be moved off to intermediate dialogs. This will result
in a program that strives to fit the end user's needs as best possible. Your
"vote" counts so please let me know which options/arguments you use most
frequently.

DONATIONS:

Although this is "free" software, all costs involved in supporting this project
are directly born by me. If you find this program useful and would like to
contribute to its further development as well as offset site hosting, domain
name, and other related costs, please consider making a small donation via
PayPal. Doing so will place you on a priority mailing list for bug fixes,
updates and future releases.

It goes without saying that a donation is certainly appreciated and I will
personally thank you then, and in advance as well!
My PayPal account is mike_wells@cox.net.
