Version 0.0.4 includes some major changes and improvements;

Along with this version comes a move to SourceForge.net. Please take advantage
of the features offered there including the new Forums and Bug Reporting and
Tracking. Visit the project area at http://sourceforge.net/projects/aria2fe/.

1.	The application is now statically linked against the Qt libs so a local
		machine install of Qt/Qt libs is no longer required.

2.	The project has been ported to Qt 4 (from Qt 3.3.8) and all of the
		code, classes and widgets are now Qt 4 compliant.

3.	The HTTP(S)/FTP/Metalink/BitTorrent dialogs remain work in process for
		this release. Use the Additional Opts (+ Opts) edit to specify any options
		your download	requires that are not shown on the MainWindow. Every effort
		will be made to include the functioning dialogs in 0.0.5.

4.  Considerable modification has been done to the MainWindow. If you have been
		using earlier versions please take some time to familiarize yourself with
		the changes.

5.  The application is now argument compatible with aria2 0.11.4.
		aria2 0.11.5 is a maintenance release and has no impact on argument specs.

6.  Every attempt was made to maintain backward compatibility with the
		*.conf files.  However, due to the complexion of changes, some modifcation
		to the .conf file format was unavoidable. Update your existing *.conf
		files as follows:

		6.1		Execute aria2fe.
		6.2.	Load the .conf file to be updated.
		6.3.	Make any necessary default changes to the following options;
					"File Allocation" - old Method default was "none", new is "prealloc".
					"Size < Limit" - replaced "HTTP Passwd". Update to "5M".
					"Concurrent Downloads" - replaced "HTTP User". Update to "5".
					"Force Sequential" - replaced "Check Integrity". Update to "false".
					"Parameterized" - replaced "Chunk Checksum". Update to "false".
		6.4.	Save the file.
		6.5.	Quit.

7.	The "Run/Launch" function has been relocated to the MenuBar/ToolBar->Tools.

8.	Refer to the CHANGELOG doc for a complete list of changes for 0.0.4.
