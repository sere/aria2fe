INSTALL


Upgrade:

Out with the old, in with the new! Simply replace the existing aria2fe binary
after unpacking the new tarball. Refer to the appropriate steps in First
Install (below).


First Install:

The EASY Way:

Make a copy of the tarball you downloaded (just in case!).

Unpack the tarball to your home directory (~/). This will add a new directory
named aria2fe-0.0.5 (~/aria2fe-0.0.5).

Copy ~/aria2fe-0.0.5/bin/aria2fe (the binary) to ~/bin. Your home "bin"
directory should already be in your path.

Create a desktop icon (or add an entry to your desktop menu). aria2fe logo
icons (22x22 and 32x32) are located in the ~/aria2fe-0.0.5/src/pixmaps
directory. If you prefer, aria2fe can be launched from the command line.

Insure that the aria2 and xterm binaries are installed in your path.

That wasn't too hard now, was it?

Note:	If aria2fe fails to launch, check permissions and your lib dependencies.


The HARDER Way:

The only difference here is that you will copy the aria2fe binary to a system
bin directory - and that would be /usr/local/bin. I do not recommend this
approach, however, it is your system. Be aprised that you do so at your own
risk!

Open a terminal, gain root and cp ~/aria2fe-0.0.5/bin/aria2fe /usr/local/bin.

Everything else is the same as the "EASY Way".


The HARDEST Way:

"qmake", "make" and "make install" the project after modifying the .pro file
accordingly.
NOTE: A standalone binary requires a static Qt installation.


If you encounter problems other than those mentioned above, take 2 aspirin,
drink plenty of alcohol, get plenty of rest, and call me in the morning!
