BUGS


Please submit all bugs via the Tracker->Bugs area located at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aria2fe/.

Bug reporting usage rules:

Try to ascertain the root of the problem. That is, which program could be
causing it. Some basics appy here; aria2fe constructs the command line syntax
for aria2 and passes the arguments to xterm (there are arguments passed to
xterm as well for program operation and control). xterm in turn passes the
aria2 arguments to aria2 and executes the application. aria2 configures and
controls all download operations. Given all of this, it is important to try
and determine the cause. Attempt to reconstuct the problem, and if you can not
do so, wait until it occurs again before reporting it. Get screenshots (if
applicable) and document the problem thoroughly. Reporting in a manner such
as "aria2fe doesn't work on my computer" leaves much to be imagined and
desired. Be specific and provide as much detailed information as you can.
Obviously, the more work you do up front, could end up resulting in a more
timely resolution.

Bugs determined to be caused by aria2 or xterm should be reported to the
maintainers of those programs.

Lastly, if you have done your utmost in trying to determine which of the little
"guys" is causing the problem and you just can not do so, feel free to submit
the bug per above.
